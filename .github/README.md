## Why should I use this startpage?
Github has a lot of startpage repos. However, the vast majority of them are slow to load or require the internet (\*cough\* \*cough\* [Bento](https://github.com/migueravila/Bento)). Rather than use some framework or spin up a GitHub Pages server, why not just load a few files using very basic HTML/CSS/JS?

## Features
* Time of day message
* Custom theming (can also load themes depending on the time of day)
* Slap all of your bookmarks into a single js object
* Bookmark groups
* Keyboard shortcuts to each bookmark link (inspired by [tilde](https://github.com/xvvvyz/tilde))
* 100% guaranteed to work with any screen/window size and not look broken, I swear.
* NO BLOATED FRAMEWORK!

## Installation
I reccomend signing Nue Startpage as a web extension per deepjyoti30's instructions [for his startpage](https://github.com/deepjyoti30/startpage/wiki/Installation).

## Configuration
Install the used font and modify the html \<link\> so you don't need the internet for it to load nicely. Or, change the font to something you already have installed.

Regarding the configuration in script.js, all the needed/optional values are included and should be pretty self explanatory. 

## Anything else?
Feel free to contribute, and if you share this or use some part of it in your own work, please give credit.

Some things that should be worked on:
* A user-editable configuration (so making changes are much easier)
